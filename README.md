# My-android-game
This is my first unfinished android game created a while ago using libgdx engine.

This game was made as an excersise and was supposed to be like a well known PC game Heroes of Might and Magic III. 
I didn't have the time and skills to create my own graphics so I figured for the time of creation I would use it's graphics and since the 
project isn't finished it remained unchanged. 

It isn't very well written, but at the time I was more focused on creating the game itself then the optimalisation and overall code.
I wanted to create like a schema of the game and then clean the code and make it more readable and everything, but I didn't have the time.

Here are some screenshots:
